                <dd>I have around 3 years of experience with programming in general, but I've been around computers all my life. 
                    I have taken Coding 1-2 (Python), Coding 3-4 (Python, HTML/CSS), and Computer Science Principals (JavaScript) in High School.
                    I am currently enrolled in West-Mec Coding which mainly focuses on front-end development. It is a 2 year program which I have finished a year of, and entering into my 2nd year.
